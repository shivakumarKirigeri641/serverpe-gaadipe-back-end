/**
 * src/whatsapp/flow.js
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The conversation. One function decides what GaadiPe says next.
 *
 * State lives in whatsapp_sessions.state, never in memory, because a bot that
 * forgets where someone was when the server restarts is worse than no bot.
 *
 * STATES SO FAR
 *   new              nobody has spoken yet — anything gets the welcome
 *   main_menu        welcome sent, waiting for owner or partner
 *   owner_consent    owner chose; terms shown, waiting for agreement
 *   partner_consent  partner chose; partner policy shown, waiting for agreement
 *   owner_start      agreed — waiting for a vehicle number
 *   owner_confirm    a number was read; waiting for confirm or re-enter
 *   partner_start    agreed — ready for the partner flow (next to build)
 *
 * WHY CONSENT IS ITS OWN STATE: agreement has to be a deliberate act with a
 * timestamp against it, not something buried in a welcome message nobody read.
 * The tap is recorded in event_log, so months later it can be shown exactly
 * when a given mobile number agreed and to which documents.
 *
 * Nothing in this file ever starts a conversation. Every message here is a
 * reply to something the person just sent — that is the product's rule, not
 * only Meta's: GaadiPe does not message anyone who has not messaged first.
